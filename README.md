# Amforeas
## A RESTful Interface for JDBC

Amforeas is a Java server which provides CRUD operations over any JDBC supported RDBMS using REST.

By REST we basically mean that the different CRUD operations are performed by different HTTP methods:

* POST to create a resource
* GET to read a resource
* PUT to update a resource
* DELETE to delete a resource

Amforeas is based on the premise that you love your database, hence there's no administration. If there's something missing in Amforeas, it probably means you have to do it in your database (roles, triggers, stored procedures, views, etc.)

## Features
* Easy installation & configuration.
* Support for any RDBMS with a JDBC Driver.
* Support for multiple databases on a single instance.
* Tested for security and performance.
* No administration.
* Grails style Dynamic Finders
* Model/Store API for Python.
* Convention over configuration
* Call functions and stored procedures.
* Deploy in your favorite JEE application server (JBoss, Tomcat, Glassfish).

##Usages
This are some projects where Amforeas is ideal:

* JavaScript applications without any server-side coding (Reach, Angular, AJAX).
* Python, Perl and Bash scripts without any database driver.
* ETL & KPIs.
* Data-warehousing.
* Cron jobs.
* Provide restricted access to a database server.

## Future
* GraphQL
* OAuth authentication
* More RDBMS dialects
* NoSQL database dialects
* First Level Cache

## Installation

## Examples
This examples are from data when running Amforeas en demo mode.

### Read (GET) a resource
To read (GET) a user with id 1 from its table, we perform the following:

```
$curl -i -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:8080/amforeas/demo1/user/1"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: 2012-03-26T23:23:48.470+02:00
Content-Count: 1
Content-Location: user
Content-MD5: uLcUX7L3SZknHpLvhUkERg==
Content-Length: 143
Server: Jetty(8.1.2.v20120308)
```

```json
{
   "success":true,
   "cells":[
      {
         "birthday":"1992-01-15",
         "credit":"0.00",
         "lastupdate":"2012-03-27T14:23:48.466+02:00",
         "name":"bar",
         "age":33,
         "id":1
      }
   ]
}
```

This is the full HTTP with its header and body. As you can see, we asked in the HTTP request header `Accept: application/json` for a JSON representation of the user entity with id 1 in the database/schema `demo1`.

By default, Amforeas uses JSON as the transport format, but you can also use XML by simply changing the Accept header:

```
$ curl -i -X GET -H "Accept: application/xml" "http://localhost:8080/amforeas/demo1/user/1"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/xml
Date: 2012-03-26T23:31:06.110+02:00
Content-Count: 1
Content-Location: user
Content-MD5: eOsCCV/1/zkXhxKIRMV4ug==
Content-Length: 261
Server: Jetty(8.1.2.v20120308)
```

```xml
<response>
  <success>true</success>
  <resource>user</resource>
  <rows>
    <row roi="0">
      <columns>
        <birthday>1992-01-15</birthday>
        <credit>45.00</credit>
        <lastupdate>2012-03-27T14:31:06.110+02:00</lastupdate>
        <name>foo user</name>
        <age>30</age>
        <id>1</id>
      </columns>
    </row>
  </rows>
</response>
```

If the resource doesn't exists, you'll get a 404

```
$ curl -i -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:8080/amforeas/demo1/user/2"
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json
Date: 2012-03-26T23:37:54.100+02:00
Content-MD5: 0+WJ/rKID3SXLnjerbee1g==
Content-Length: 39
Content-Length: 39
Content-Location: user
Server: Jetty(8.1.2.v20120308)
```

```json
{"success":false,"message":"Not Found"}
```

Depending on RDBMS support, SQL errors will be mapped to HTTP errors.  

* * *

### Create (POST) a resource
To insert (POST) a new registry in the user table, we perform the following:

```
$curl -i -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"my foo user", "age":30, "credit":45.0}' \
  "http://localhost:8080/amforeas/demo1/user"
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Date: 2012-03-26T23:29:17.125+02:00
Content-Count: 1
Content-MD5: eLzHpBV+Q6y46F/teUejMA==
Content-Length: 30
Server: Jetty(8.1.2.v20120308)
```

```json
{"success":true,"cells":[ {}]}
```

The HTTP response code changed to 201 (Created) which means the entity was created successfully.

* * *

### Update (PUT) a resource

You can also update values by providing a PUT request with the ID and the columns/values.

```
$ curl -i -X PUT -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"im updated!", "age":40}' \
  "http://localhost:8080/amforeas/demo1/user/3"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: 2012-03-26T23:36:14.299+02:00
Content-Count: 1
Content-Location: user
Content-MD5: dtt+NFNh9z5Ssh5ZYGt9yw==
Content-Length: 152
Server: Jetty(8.1.2.v20120308)
```

```json
{
   "success":true,
   "cells":[
      {
         "birthday":"2012-03-27",
         "credit":"45.00",
         "lastupdate":"2012-03-27T14:36:14.299+02:00",
         "name":"im updated!",
         "age":40,
         "id":3
      }
   ]
}
```

* * *

### Delete (DELETE) a resource

To delete you use a DELETE request with the ID in the table.

```
curl -i -X DELETE -H "Accept: application/json"  "http://localhost:8080/amforeas/demo1/user/2"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: 2012-03-26T23:37:20.803+02:00
Content-Count: 1
Content-Location: user
Content-MD5: eLzHpBV+Q6y46F/teUejMA==
Content-Length: 30
Server: Jetty(8.1.2.v20120308)
```

```json
{"success":true,"cells":[ {}]}
```

* * *

### Tables and meta

For Amforeas, everything after the amforeas/ path is an accessible resource, for example, the demo1 schema:

```
$ curl -i -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:8080/amforeas/demo1"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: 2012-03-26T23:39:36.340+02:00
Content-Count: 8
Content-Location: demo1
Content-MD5: Fq5vDIHzxEYTBBeamLXbGQ==
Content-Length: 2337
Server: Jetty(8.1.2.v20120308)
```

```json
{
   "success":true,
   "cells":[
      {
         "table_name":"CAR",
         "type_cat":"null",
         "remarks":"null",
         "type_schem":"null",
         "hsqldb_type":"MEMORY",
         "commit_action":"null",
         "table_schem":"PUBLIC",
         "table_cat":"PUBLIC",
         "self_referencing_col_name":"null",
         "type_name":"null",
         "ref_generation":"null",
         "table_type":"TABLE",
         "read_only":"FALSE"
      },
      ...
      {
         "table_name":"USER",
         "type_cat":"null",
         "remarks":"null",
         "type_schem":"null",
         "hsqldb_type":"MEMORY",
         "commit_action":"null",
         "table_schem":"PUBLIC",
         "table_cat":"PUBLIC",
         "self_referencing_col_name":"null",
         "type_name":"null",
         "ref_generation":"null",
         "table_type":"TABLE",
         "read_only":"FALSE"
      }
   ]
}
```

If you ask for the database, its entities are returned. You can also query for a table's metadata with HEAD

```
$ curl -i -X HEAD -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:8080/amforeas/demo1/user"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: 2012-03-26T23:42:15.254+02:00
Content-Location: user
User: ID=INTEGER(11);NAME=VARCHAR(25);AGE=INTEGER(11);BIRTHDAY=DATE(10);LASTUPDATE=TIMESTAMP(26);CREDIT=DECIMAL(8)
Content-MD5: dWYBu98TXrlGBjdvsDa8Gg==
Content-Length: 801
Server: Jetty(8.1.2.v20120308)
```

In this case, the HEAD response doesn't include any body, but your table metadata is included in a header with the name of it.

* * *

## Querying

Apart of using GET requests, you can also use two more ways of querying

### Calling functions or stored procedures

```
$ curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[{"value":2010, "name":"year", "outParameter":false, "type":"INTEGER", "index":1},{"name":"out_total", "outParameter":true, "type":"INTEGER", "index":2}]' "http://localhost:8080/amforeas/demo1/call/get_year_sales"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: */*
Content-Count: 1
Content-Location: get_year_sales
Date: 2012-04-02T01:24:35.677+02:00
Content-MD5: mRewGokS4XVF1CEgjXrPxg==
Content-Length: 44
```
```json
{"success":true,"cells":[ {"out_total":12}]}
```
As you can see, you call your stored procedure `/amforeas/demo1/call/get_year_sales` with a POST request, giving Amforeas the needed parameters in the request's body:

```json
[
  {"value":2010, "name":"year", "outParameter":false, "type":"INTEGER", "index":1},
  {"name":"out_total", "outParameter":true, "type":"INTEGER", "index":2}
]
```

* * *

### Amforeas also provides DynamicFinders inspired by Grails

```
$ curl -i -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:8080/amforeas/demo1/user/dynamic/findAllByIdBetween?args=0&args=4"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: 2012-03-26T23:34:50.145+02:00
Content-Count: 4
Content-Location: user
Content-MD5: 3mTUmmN9ody68WB6/YXz7Q==
Content-Length: 507
Server: Jetty(8.1.2.v20120308)
```

Here we are telling Amforeas to find all `demo1.user` entities where id is between 0 and 4

```json
{
   "success":true,
   "cells":[
      {
         "birthday":"1982-12-13",
         "credit":"32.50",
         "lastupdate":"2012-03-27T14:34:50.144+02:00",
         "name":"foo",
         "age":30,
         "id":0
      },
      ...
      {
         "birthday":"2012-03-27",
         "credit":"45.00",
         "lastupdate":"2012-03-27T14:34:50.145+02:00",
         "name":"my foo user",
         "age":30,
         "id":3
      }
   ]
}
```

## Date, Timestamp, Time

Amforeas uses JodaTime to handle all this conversions. Specifically, we use the ISODateTimeFormat. So if you want to communicate with Amforeas and read/write this data types, you must use the ISO format.

Date columns use the format `yyyy-MM-dd` as specified in the date() method.

Datetime columns use the format `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZZ` as specified in the dateTime() method.

Time columns use the format `HH:mm:ss.SSSZZ` as specified in the time() method.

For example, a user table with a birthday field of type DATE, and a lastupdate TIMESTAMP is returned as this:

```json
{
  "birthday":"1982-12-13",
  "credit":"32.50",
  "lastupdate":"2011-12-12T22:19:14.931+01:00",
  "name":"foo",
  "age":30,
  "id":0
 }
```

## Technology

### RESTful
Neither REST nor RESTful webservices are a defined standard but The [Atom Publishing Protocol](http://atomenabled.org/developers/protocol/atom-protocol-spec.php)
gives a pretty good layout to conform to. Amforeas tries to follow the conventions on this document.

### Java
Amforeas works as a stand alone server or daemon and uses the following open source projects:

* Jetty 9
* Jersey 2
* Maven 3
* Jakarta Commons DBUtils
* Jakarta Commons DBCP
* Jakarta Commons Lang
* JAX-RS & Jackson
* Logback
* Joda Time
* JUnit & Mockito
